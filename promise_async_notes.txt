✅ A Promise is like saying: “I don’t have the data yet, but I promise I will give it to you soon.”
✅ A Promise is an object that represents a future result of an asynchronous operation.
✅ Async functions always return a Promise.
✅ Await pauses the function execution until the Promise settles (resolves or rejects).
✅ Await only works inside async functions.
✅ Await makes async code look and behave like synchronous code (easier to read).
✅ .then() is a method to handle the result of a Promise once it's resolved.
✅ .then() chains actions to run after a Promise resolves.
✅ Without await or .then(), calling a Promise returns a "pending" state.
✅ If you don’t await or use .then(), the rest of the code continues and skips the result.
✅ Asynchronous functions don’t block other code, but inside them, await will pause next steps.
✅ Use async/await when you want cleaner, linear-style code flow.
✅ Use .then() when chaining or when not inside an async function.
