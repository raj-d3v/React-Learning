# üß† React Learning Projects

This repository documents my React.js learning journey. Each folder represents a mini project or concept I've practiced to build a solid foundation in React. It's a growing collection of hands-on experience as I progress through different topics.

## üìÅ Project Folders

### 1. `conditional-render-react`

A simple component (`UserGreetings`) that demonstrates **conditional rendering** in React using the **ternary operator**. It displays a personalized welcome message if a user is logged in, or a prompt to log in if not.

**Key concepts:**

- Conditional rendering using `? :` inside JSX.
- Reusable JSX elements (`welcome` and `login` variables).
- **PropTypes** for type-checking props like `isLoggedIn` (boolean) and `user` (string), which helps catch bugs during development.

### 2. `my-react-app`

This is my core practice app generated using `create-react-app`, where I explored several foundational concepts:

- **JSX Syntax:** Embedding HTML-like syntax directly inside JavaScript files.
- **Using JavaScript in Components:** Writing logic (e.g., expressions, functions, conditionals) inside JSX using curly braces `{}`.
- **Working with Assets:** Importing and displaying images using the `src/assets` folder.
- **Styling Techniques:**
  - ‚úÖ **Inline styling** ‚Äì writing CSS directly in the component via style objects.
  - ‚úÖ **Global CSS (`index.css`)** ‚Äì applying universal styles to the entire app.
  - ‚úÖ **CSS Modules** ‚Äì scoped component-specific styles using `.module.css`.

This project serves as my playground for experimenting with essential React features.

### 3. `react-facts-project`

A fun single-page static site that displays **random facts about React**. Built to strengthen understanding of:

- Functional components
- Static data rendering
- CSS styling
- Using `create-react-app` for quick setups

It‚Äôs a great example of a clean, minimal component-based React UI.

### 4. `travel-journal-project`

A simple journal layout showcasing multiple travel locations, dynamically rendered using props and mapping over an array of data.

**What I learned:**

- How to **pass data via props**
- How to **map over arrays** to generate reusable UI components
- Component reusability and clean separation of concerns

## üìÑ Notes

### `React Dev Setup & Understanding structure.txt`

Includes notes on how to set up a React development environment and understand the folder structure created by `create-react-app`.

### `React.txt`

My raw and ongoing notes containing concepts, code snippets, and explanations as I learn new React ideas.
